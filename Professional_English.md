### The context of the project and why it was complex
Well, the project looks like easy first, but the soluctions' infrastrucure was not so easy.
There are more than four thousand machine spread up for all Brazil.
You can imagine a machine in each gas station, and one more to each parking lot, other one to a fast food drive-thru.

### The specific challenges you encountered along the way
The worst challenge in this project was the fact of this infrastructure is all a non-standard environment. Some machines are in a VPN, others machine are in a Non-VPN, i.e., our communication was only over Anydesk connection.
Some machines are Windows 11, server 2012, server 2020, some others server 2022, others Linux Debian and some machines Oracle Linux.
So, this infrastructure was really unuseful to make deploys.

### The decisions you made to solve each problem
We already are using an EDI application called Axway, but the it only send and receive files.
That's when we decide to build an application (called as DS) to trasport files and run scripts using an especific file to make it and other to send us the machine status, configuration and program versions.
Still it didn't help to solve the versions and configuration discrepancy problems because we didn't know how was the machine park.
Then I build an application to read the program versions and configurations, insert it on a PostgreSql data base and after that the application compare the oficial configurations and if it has any discrepant information a package is sent through DS application to solve the difference.

### The measurable results you achieved
The results are:
First - The park have became more homogeneous on version and configuration
Second - We reduce the human mistakes
Third - We was able to automate the rollout process
And last - We know now how are our machine park and when each machine has received the last version of some application or configuration.
